        From the mind and pen of former Marvel visionary concept artist Anthony Francisco, Creature
        Chronicles: Exiled Aliens begins with 10,000 hand drawn avatars representing an ancient race of rare
        beings. Divided between a pre-sale and public sale, these NFT avatars are broken into an alien
        hierarchy, assigned traits, randomly generated, and revealed to the world sometime after the Geminids
        Meteor Shower.
      </Typography>
